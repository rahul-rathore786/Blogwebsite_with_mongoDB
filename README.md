## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://www.linkpicture.com/q/Blog-1_4.png)

I've built an interactive and user-friendly blog website using technologies like EJS, CSS, Node.js with Express, and MongoDB as the database. This website lets people easily sign up or log in, giving them the power to write and share their ideas using interesting blog posts.

 EJS helps to show things on the website quickly, while CSS makes it look nice and work well on different devices. The technical part of the website, made with Node.js and Express, helps messages go between the website and the server smoothly. 

With MongoDB, the information about the blogs, like titles, descriptions, and who wrote them, gets stored neatly. When someone puts up a blog, the website adds it to the rest of the blogs, so everyone can see it. 

The main page of the website shows all these blogs and lets visitors enjoy lots of different topics. This project makes it simple to exchange ideas and keeps people engaged with a bunch of interesting content.



## Built With

* Nodejs With expressjs
* MongoDB With mongoose 
* EJS, CSS, JavaScript 

## Getting Started

Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions on how people can get started and install your project from GitHub:

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Go to your project's GitHub repository.
   - Click the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of the page. This creates a copy of your project in the user's GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Navigate to the user's GitHub account where the forked repository is now available.
   - Click the "Code" button and copy the repository URL.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
   - Use the `git clone` command followed by the copied URL to clone the repository to your computer.
     ```
     git clone <copied-repo-url>
     ```


### Installation


3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Navigate into the cloned project folder using the `cd` command.
     ```
     cd <project-folder-name>
     ```
   - Install the required project dependencies using a package manager like npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn. Run either:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
  

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - If your project uses environment variables, create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
   - Add the required environment variables in the format `VARIABLE_NAME=value`.

5. **Start the Application:**
   - After installing dependencies and configuring environment variables, start the application using the command:
     ```
     npm start
     ```
 

6. **Access the Application:**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3100` (or the specified port if different).
   - You should see your project's application running locally on your machine.

7. **Make Changes and Push to GitHub:**
   - Make any necessary changes or customizations to the project.
   - Use the `git add` command to stage the changes.
   - Use the `git commit` command to commit the staged changes along with a meaningful message.
   - Use the `git push` command to push the changes to your GitHub repository.

8. **Create a Pull Request (Optional):**
   - If you've made changes that you'd like to contribute back to the original project, you can create a pull request.
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Click the "Pull Request" button to create a new pull request.
   - Follow the instructions to compare and request your changes to be merged into the original project.

These steps should guide users through the process of getting started with your project and installing it on their GitHub account. Make sure to provide clear instructions, including any project-specific details, in your project's README file for users to refer to.
